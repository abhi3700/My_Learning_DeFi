My learning about DeFi

## Education
* Uniswap forked out of Bancor.
* Bancor algorithm has been used in 
	- EOSIO RAM market to decide the RAM price. RAM <-> EOS
	- my project TOE (A decentralized Ride sharing platform) to decide the Rides' price. RIDEX <-> EOS
	- [ ] my DeFi project - Cropfi (Stake ur tokens to earn more).
* Liquidity provider: who adds funds into the Liquidity Pool to earn fees from trades in the Swap Pool and also savings interest income. [Source](https://www.binance.com/en-IN/support/articles/dc8f28e7a98d4534ad3db88d351200fb)
