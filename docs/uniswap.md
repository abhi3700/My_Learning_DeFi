# Uniswap
## v1
* trade ETH with ERC20 & vice versa.
* The Uniswap [factory contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1/blob/master/contracts/uniswap_factory.vy) can be used to create exchange contracts for any ERC20 token that does not already have one. It also functions as a registry of ERC20 tokens that have been added to the system, and the exchange with which they are associated.
* The factory contract can be instantiated using the factory address and ABI: For more, click [here](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V1/guides/connect-to-uniswap)
